# MVP "Minimum Viable Product"

:::

## Beginner

:::warning Required
When beginning the process of building a startup or a new website, there is a tradeoff between spending time building features and releasing a version to get customer feedback.  The phrase "MVP" is used to describe building a version of the product or software that has enough functionality to interest users and allow them to provide feedback, but does not have all features or designs that a final product would have.
