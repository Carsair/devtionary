## Beginner

Boolean is a logical entity that has two value: <span style={{color: "purple"}}><em>true</em></span> or <span style={{color: "purple"}}><em>false</em></span>.

## Intermediate

Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute or repeat.

## Advanced

Booleans are most commonly used in <span style={{color: "purple"}}>if statements</span> and <span style={{color: "purple"}}>for loops</span>

## Examples

### In Code

```
const isBoolean = true
let myBoolean = false
var yourBoolean = true

if (boolean conditional) {
    // execute this code if boolean is true
}

// Example
if (yourBoolean) {
    console.log("My boolean is true")
    // expected result is to log "My boolean is true" because yourBoolean = true.
}
```

### In Conversation

> You yourself uses booleans everyday. Before you do something your brain processes if you should do it. When your brain says yes let's carry out this process, you do it. The alternative, you don't carry out the process. Booleans are most commonly used to carry out functions(processes) or loops.

## Resources for More Info

> Boolean compares to real world logic. For instance, take your light switch, if the switch is on (boolean is true), you expect there to be light (code to execute). If the switch is off (boolean is false), you expect there to not be any light (code will not execute).
