# Template Literal

## Beginner

A template literal creates a special type of string in which you are allowed to use JavaScript within the string itself. A template literal is created by using backticks.

For an example on how to use JavaScript within a template literal, check the code samples in the **Examples** section.

## Intermediate

In JavaScript, template literals allow you to perform string interpolation where you may use JavaScript within the string itself. Additionally, template literals allow for multi-line strings without having to handle newline escaping.

For examples on how to use JavaScript within a template literal, check the code samples in the **Examples** section.

## Advanced

Template literals in JavaScript allow for string interpolation, allowing for JavaScript snippets to be ran within the string itself.

This data type can be created using tagging. The tags act as a function that you can call to pass in arguments for more flexible behavior to create flexible strings in a succint manner.

## Examples

### In Code

```js
const name = "Jeff"

const example = `Hi, my name is ${name}.` // Returns "Hi, my name is Jeff."
```

### In Conversation

> A real-life comparison for template literals is like the child's game "Mad Libs." To play Mad Libs, you fill in the blanks of a pre-written story with your own words.

> Similarly, when you use a template literal, you have the base of the string to work with and insert your own JavaScript to complete the string itself.
