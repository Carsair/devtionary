# Operator
---

A JavaScript operator is a symbol that performs some logical action or process. Nearly all JS operators are mathematical symbols.

Depending on the operator you use, JavaScript will perform a different process.

## Examples

### In Code

```
const newString = "this is" + " a new string" // The + is an operator that concatenates the two strings
let number = 1 + 2 // Here, the + operator adds two numbers together

const str = "I'm a string!"
const boolean = !!str // true
// The logical operator ! turns a value into the inverse of it's boolean type.
// Using a back-to-back ! casts the original value to its original boolean value.
```

> Mathematical symbols are a great example of operators in the real world. Using a `+` in math is quite similar to using an operator in JavaScript. Using an operator, some logic will be performed.
