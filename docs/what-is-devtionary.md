# What is Devtionary?


In the real world, when you're learning a new language, a handy resource is often a good, old fashioned dictionary.

Why should learning a programming language be any different.

With Devtionary, we provide beginner-friendly, real-world, practical definitions of common programming jargon.


## Why is Devtionary useful?

We know that there are already a lot of great resources out there for learning about programming. But our goal is a little different.

Many times, you start a tutorial, open some documentation, or read an article that is meant to teach you something important - but you'll have trouble understanding what they are trying to tell you because they are using so many words that you don't know.

Then, you'll try to find out what those words are individually and end up on another documentation page that uses way too much other programming jargon...And down a rabbit hole you go.

Sometimes, you won't mind this. Rabbit holes are a great way to learn. But, most of the time, it's nice to stay focused.

That's where Devtionary comes in. Use us as a quick reference for telling you what that certain word or phrase mean and then get back to the rest of your learning process!

## Who Made Devtionary?

Originally, the idea for Devtionary started with a small Twitch community that thought we had a handy idea to help others.

Today, this resource is built open source through Github by programmers just like you. If you see that a word is missing from Devtionary or a definition could use some help, you are more than welcome to add to this project!

## How to Use Devtionary?

Use Devtionary like you would for a spoken language! We're a quick reference trying to enable you to learn more on your development journey.

You can look up words quickly in the search bar or walk around in the pages to find new words to learn!
